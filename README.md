MEDICAL TREATMENT ONTOLOGY
(PATIENT-MEDICATION RELATIONSHIPS)
Introduction - In modern healthcare, patients often face confusion or uncertainty regarding the medications they are prescribed, including how to take them, potential side effects, and dosage guidelines. To address this problem, developed a system that uses ontology to semantically represent pill-related knowledge, enabling patients to easily access accurate and personalized information about their medications.
This system, known as the Pill Information Assistant Ontology, provides a structured framework that captures essential information about pills in a format that both machines and humans can understand.It is developed using Protégé and modeled in OWL (Web Ontology Language) to support semantic reasoning and interoperability with healthcare applications.
The ontology focuses on modeling core concepts related to:
Pill details (name, dosage, maximum daily intake),
Side effects (e.g., nausea, drowsiness),
Usage instructions (e.g., should be taken with food or water),
Patient-specific guidance (e.g., dosage frequency per day).
This knowledge representation enables systems such as chatbots or mobile applications to respond intelligently to patient queries, thereby promoting safer medication practices, patient education, and automated health support.
